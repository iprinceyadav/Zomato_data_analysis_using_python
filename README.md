# Zomato Dataset Analysis

Welcome to the Zomato Dataset Analysis project! This repository contains an in-depth exploration and analysis of the Zomato dataset using Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the Zomato dataset to extract valuable insights and present them in a meaningful way using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Features
In this analysis, we:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for better usability.
- Extract key insights from the data, such as popular cuisines, restaurant ratings, pricing trends, and more.
- Visualize the data effectively to identify patterns and trends.
- Answer specific questions derived from the Zomato dataset:
  1. What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
  2. How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
  3. What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
  4. What is the average spending of couples who order most of their food online?
  5. Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
  6. Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, enabling Zomato to provide targeted offers?

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Seaborn**: For creating visually appealing statistical plots.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating detailed charts and graphs.

## Project Structure
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis process.
- `data/`: Folder containing the Zomato dataset.
- `plots/`: Folder where visualizations generated from the analysis are stored.

## Key Insights Extracted
Some of the insights derived from the dataset include:
- Distribution of restaurant ratings.
- Analysis of popular cuisines across regions.
- Relationship between cost and ratings.
- Geographical distribution of restaurants.
